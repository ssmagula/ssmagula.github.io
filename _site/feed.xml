I have my Jekyll server running locally, and it’s set up such that every edit I make to this file, or any file, will trigger Jekyll to rebuild or regenerate the site, with the changes I made incorporated. When I first heard about static site generators, I was a bit confused. If this was possible all along, why had we not been using static site generators earlier, was one of my questions. Turns out the answer is: because we didn’t really know it was so much better! At least that’s how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted using Github Pages, which makes hosting Jekyll sites relatively painless and easy, not to mention very cost-effective. The icons are by FontAwesome.com and the following&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recursive triangels, Created by Bohdan Burmich, from the Noun Project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Donut chart, created by HLD, from the Noun Project&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lightbulb, created by ImageCatalog, from the Noun Project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can rebuild the site locally in many different ways, before you do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to publish the site to Github.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to generate the site, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates the site when any file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts to your blog, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
