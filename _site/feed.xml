&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many years I’ve been designing the context in which decisions get made, but I only came to this conclusion a few years ago after I read a book called &lt;cite&gt;Nudge&lt;/cite&gt; by Richard Thaler. It was about behavioral economics. A week ago Thaler won the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. Prior to reading &lt;cite&gt;Nudge&lt;/cite&gt; I had read a lot books and papers about Human-Computer Interaction principles and psychology and was briefly a member of the Association for Computing Machines (ACM) Special Interest Grouo for Computer-Human Interaction (SIG-CHI). The ACM mainly made me jealous of those who attended SIG-CHI conferences in far-off places. HCI and psychology offered a fascinating set of theories such as Hick’s Law and Fitts’s Law that guide low-level product design decisions such as: how many options should go on a tool bar? How large should this particular button be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But product design and product management lacked a “Grand Unified Field Theory” that would tie all the various little theories together to form one overarching, highly predictive, testable theory of what we do when we work at developing new products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terrain that Thaler outlines in &lt;cite&gt;Nudge&lt;/cite&gt; is clearly a Grand Unified Field Theory that incorporates HCI and psychology to help predict and explain human decision-making, in all its irrational glory. What’s key is that understanding the irrational basis of human decision making is the first step towards improving decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, to get back to that question: what am I? I have planned and conducted discovery-oriented field studies using both qualitative techniques (partcipant-observer) and quantitative techniques such as random moment sampling and surveys. I’ve validated (and perhaps more importantly: invalidated) product ideas through research and usability testing with users and customers, but I don’t consider myself to be a user experience researcher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can write a well-formed user story, know when and why to use acceptance criteria and ‘how to demo’ criteria, and I can prioritize epics and stories by business value, user value, and properly estimated complexity. I can lead scrum and agile teams as a servant-leader and I can define product and user experience metrics. I know why and when to use entry cohort analysis, and can point to examples of how I used entry cohort analysis in the past with good effect. But I don’t consider myself to be only a product manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can design wireframes and  high-fidelity mockups of software using AI or Sketch, and can prototype interactions, transitions, and animations (HTML/CSS, Origami, or InVision). I’m a competent visual designer who is familiar with design, art, art history, principles of typography. I know the difference between Russian constructivism and neo-brutalism and can talk about the role of technology in shaping both how we design and what we design (a Worfian hypothesis). But I’m not a visual design specialist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m researcher, product manager, designer, prototyper, and curious person who likes to learn and solve problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I get asked a lot “are you a designer or product person?” This question confuses me, because to me a designer is a product person, and vice-versa. You cannot design a software product effectively without having discovered and validated product ideas with real or proxy users. You cannot properly devise and prioritize a product backlog, without a grasp of people—their goals, needs, and preferences for visual and emotional design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product thinking includes tasks like validation of problem and solution, prioritization by value and complexity, iterative planning, measurement and evaluation, software engineering principles, designing for change (often called ‘agility’). Design thinking requires an understanding of human factors and ergonomics, human psychology, behavioral economics, and the principles of visual communication and emotional design. It’s the combination of product thinking with design thinking that yields a holistic view of what the product can and should become.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does Joseph Beuys have to do with all this? When I was in high school in San Francisco, where I grew up, I discovered a German artist named Joseph Beuys. His dictum was “Everyone’s an artist.” At the time I was in love with chemistry, neurology, and science but I could see that ever-increasing specialization would be required if I became a chemist or a neurologist. This seemed odd to me. Wouldn’t I be more capable (not to mention happier) if I were a specialist in a few areas? When I was sixteen years old the answer that I received from my neurologist mentor was basically: you cannot be a specialist in a few areas. You must choose, and choose soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I read an auto-biographical essay by Joseph Beuys, in it he described being a biological sciences student at a prestigious German university. He was a good student but an uncertainty was nagging him. He felt possibly unsuited to become a professional biologist. This resonated with my sixteen-year old self. Beuys described one particular afternoon when he experienced his epiphany. He was in a lecture hall listening to a professor who had spent his entire life studying the inner organelles of a tiny one-celled organism. Beuys stood up and walked out of the lecture hall, never to return to science. Instead he turned to art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He became one of the most influential artists of the Post-WWII era, helping to found the Fluxus movement which inspired many artists to think more conceptually about their art, and what could be accomplished with it. Joseph Beuys saw transforming society as his mission, but it was not his art that would transform society, it was everyman who would do that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Joseph Beuys believed that it was possible to transform society 
through the creativity of every individual. He emerged as an 
artist amid Germany's post-war reconstruction, claiming for 
art a unique role in the spiritual regeneration of society, 
in opposition to a materialistic culture. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most product managers, researchers, designers, and software engineers who toil long hours at technology startups and corporations would say that they are motivated to work because, deep down, they are striving ‘make the world a better place’—through software. And software is changing the world, sometimes for the better. Look at the advances we’ve made in the last 20 years: peer-to-peer technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, mobile computing, augmented reality, new markets, technology-based crypto-currencies… I could go on and on. But by becoming increasingly specialized, narrowly focused on ‘just engineering’ or ‘just designing’ we risk losing the sort of holistic, overarching, transformative vision that can only come from all of us collaborating together. If you want to make the world a better place, the creativity of every individual is needed. This is what Beuys has to teach us.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Stefan Smagula</name></author><summary type="html">PEOPLE ASK are you a product designer, a UX person, a researcher, a prototyper, or a product manager?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Making this site</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2017/04/02/welcome-to-new-site-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making this site" /><published>2017-04-02T10:27:14-05:00</published><updated>2017-04-02T10:27:14-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2017/04/02/welcome-to-new-site-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/04/02/welcome-to-new-site-jekyll.html">&lt;p&gt;YOU WILL FIND this post in your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory, if you’re managing a Jekyll site. Jekyll is a static site generator, written in Ruby. Here’s how it works: you install Jekyll locally:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you generate the scaffolding for a new site with a brief incantation like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jekyll&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you simply move to the site directory you just created&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;my&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kp&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then from inside that directory, you run the Jekyll server&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;~&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/my-new-site-name $ bundle exec jekyll serve --watch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the server is ‘watching’ your site for changes, as you add code and content, Jekyll automatically re-generates the entire site. In my case, with just a few pages, the process takes .22 seconds. Then you push the site to a git repository like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;, and publish it via Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;why-jekyll&quot;&gt;WHY JEKYLL?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do with Jekyll? Well, pretty much anything that you can do with Ruby. If you’re like me, and eager to learn more Ruby, then Jekyll is a great way to ease into things. Take a look at the list of blog posts in  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt; (or the footer of the home page), under the hood there’s a bit of embedded Ruby in the HTML and this Ruby says: make a list of all the blog articles, discard all but the most recent three posts, then create a 23-word excerpt for each, and output the hed, dek, small image, and excerpt into these HTML tags here. The hed, dek, etc. are all defined in the front matter of the markdown file you use to create the post. ‘Front matter’ sound confusing? Just open the sample posts that are baked into the default new site. It’ll make instant sense. They’re just variables that you can refer to elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found Jekyll’s includes and layouts easy to navigate. You put reusable code for the head, header, and footers in the includes directory, then include them into layouts you create, for example a  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; layout. When you create a new instance of a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page&lt;/code&gt;, it knows that a  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page&lt;/code&gt; is just a slight variation on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; layout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there’s no database in the backend, there’s reduced complexity, increased security, and each page is much snappier to load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first heard about static site generators, I was a bit confused. If this were possible, why aren’t more bloggy sites using static site generators? Turns out the answer is: because we just needed a little time to figure out how simple it is. At least that’s how I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;credits&quot;&gt;CREDITS&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is hosted using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.io/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;, which makes hosting HTTPS sites relatively painless and easy, not to mention very cost-effective (gratis). I used the Bootstrap Agency theme for its animated fixed nav bar and nice timeline CSS. All icons are by &lt;a href=&quot;http://FontAwesome.io/&quot;&gt;FontAwesome&lt;/a&gt;, and from time to time I use the following icons from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/&quot;&gt;Noun Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recursive triangles, Created by Bohdan Burmich&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Donut chart, created by HLD&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lightbulb, created by ImageCatalog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full-bleed image at the top of the site is a photogram of pine needles. I chose this image because it reveals the rhythm, inner structure of something simple, something we take for granted. It is “Dennenaalden, anonymous, 1840 - 1845” and is part of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/my/collections/183512--stefan-smagula/patterns/objecten#/RP-F-F15045,0&quot;&gt;Rijskmuseum collection&lt;/a&gt; in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;rebuilding-and-publishing&quot;&gt;REBUILDING AND PUBLISHING&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can rebuild the site locally in many different ways, but using the –watch flag is simple. When you’re ready, you publish the entire site with a new incantation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;origin&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;master&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add new posts to your blog, simply add a file in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext&lt;/code&gt; and includes the necessary front matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
