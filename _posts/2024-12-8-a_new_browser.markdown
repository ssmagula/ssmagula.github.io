MORTON GREETED ME with a conspiratorial smile, which was odd because we had just met. He was the C-level executive of a company, and I was just some dude looking for work. He asked a question that required imagination: "If I gave you a Web page that 20 million people look at once a day, every day, what would you do with that page?" I said something totally crazy that I instantly regretted, but it was too late. The call came from the recruiter later that day: you're hired.

I met with Morton once or twice about the work ahead of us. It involved creating a browser, or at least the chrome, or user interface, that wraps around the browser. Then I saw an email that went to the whole company; Morton was no longer with the company. This is probably not a good sign, I remember thinking. Later that day I ran into him as he was waiting for the elevator to exit the building. I said hi and shook his hand. He gave me that conspiratorial smile again and said, "Stefan, I've gotta to go now, but I know you all will figure it out." As the elevator door was closing he said: "You can do it." I liked Morton. I never saw him again.

#### LIKE A TANK

The head of product management gathered the product development team in a windowless room for the kickoff of this revamped browser. We saw charts and stats, we learned about users, usage, and revenue. Then came the ominous slide: the main source of revenue was disappearing. We barely had time to consider the ramifications because next came a slide that showed us a new way to make money, and it involved a new partnership. The partner had already signed a letter of intent, we were told, so we were good.

#### 12 MONTHS TO FINISH

"The requirements are all right here" said the head of product, as he held up a hefty tome bound with a large binder clip at the top. "All you have to do now is just write the code. You have 12 months to finish."  

He asked if there were questions. Some of the software engineers were a little skeptical that the application described could be designed/developed in 12 months. "How did you arrive at that estimate?" One guy asked. I remember the head of product's response: "We're like a tank rolling towards victory. If you get in the way of victory, or if any of you get in the way, the tank will roll right over you."

#### PRODUCTIVITY SUITE
I started to read the 200 page product requirements document. It said we were going to create a browser with an integrated Web-based productivity suite: an email client, a calendar, a stock portfolio, and other stuff, like a searchbox that generated leads for our search partner. All the applications would be Web-based.

I can't remember who it was, but someone said "Hey, check out this browser by some grad student: it's got a tabbed UI" and sent me a link. I installed it. This grad student's browser allowed you to create tabs. Each was a new Web page. We all instantly realized this was a huge productivity and performance improvement, and started talking about doing the same thing. 

I stood with the Tech Lead at a whiteboard. He drew a diagram of the browser's architecture, boxes nested in boxes and then we talked about this tabbed UI. He asked me questions like: "What if you open 100 tabs?" and "What happens when I close the last tab?" and similar. I remember sketching a set of tabs on the whiteboard, and then we came up with some good guesses for behaviors. Not too long later he pulled up a browser with tabs. We played with it, and tweaked a few values. It worked.

The head of the user research team was not happy with the tabbed browser. She said: our subscribers have simple needs, and want a simple browser. "They just want to to check their email, maybe search for something. That's it." She said. "Why do we want to complicate their experience with tons of extra tabs and stuff they don't want or need?" I started to wonder if a tabbed browser was something I wanted, not what most people wanted. 

Right about then, we hired a design agency to help with design. Tabs were in.

#### NEXT INSTALLMENT
I'll share some lessons I learned when a developer had a medical emergency at his desk and was wheeled out of the office by the Emergency Medical Services.
