#### "HOW DID YOU CONVINCE MICROSOFT?"
Right before the Dot Com Boom 1.0 blossomed into peak irrational exuberance I wrote my Master’s thesis called “The Almost Chosen Ones” about technogical anxiety and American religions. With MA in hand, I started working at a medium sized software company in Austin, Texas. 

This company had over 50 million subscribers paying $20 or $30 a month for a service. (I’m going to keep things intentionally vague). To use the service, you would launch a customized Web browser. Here’s the kicker, the part that's critical to the whole thing, the service was not at all distinctive, better, or even different than what was offered by 30 similar companies at the time, but this company was much more successful than those other companies.

Why was it was more successful? Somewhere along the way, some smart people in business development had figured out that Microsoft would be willing to pre-install this browser and place an alias on the Windows desktop. When people bought a new windows computer, a percentage of them would launch that pre-installed browser, and then they'd sign up. 

#### IT'S EASY

I was friends with the business development lead who negotiated the terms of the agreement with Microsoft. So one day I invited her and her boss over for dinner and I think I grilled some fajitas and we talked about work. I said something like “So, how on earth do you two convince Microsoft to put our icon on every single Windows desktop?”

“It’s easy. We give Microsoft a s&$% ton of money” my friend said.

I asked: “So Microsoft doesn’t own a rival service that they’d rather promote on every single desktop they sell in North America?”

“Not yet!” She replied.

#### LESSONS
That night I learned an important lesson: even if your browser is not the system default, getting the browser icon in front of people at the right time and place, and providing something that you can't get from the system default browser are the keys to success. It's not that offering a better product or service doesn't help, but without distribution, even a demonstrably better product will struggle. 

#### IRRATIONAL MAN AND WOMAN
Humans are irrational. We do not make perfectly rational decisions. Status quo bias refers to the tendency to use a default, even if selecting something better would take just a minute or two. Convenience often trumps quality or price. So when people see that there's a default browser they think "the operating system made this the default because it works well on my computer. And its convenient." When they see a browser icon on the dektop, they think: "Maybe there's a cheaper or better option, but this is easy, and I trust that this service will work on my computer. It's convenient."

#### NEXT
I'll tell you about the adventure we had reinventing the customized browser that was preinstalled on every Microsoft desktop in North America. Spoiler: it was a tabbed browser and it predated Firefox, the "first browser with tabs."
