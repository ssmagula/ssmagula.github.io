YOU WILL FIND this post in your `_posts` directory, if you're managing a Jekyll-backed site. I have my Jekyll server running locally, and it's set up such that every edit I make to this file, or any file, will trigger Jekyll to rebuild or regenerate the site, with the changes I made incorporated. When I first heard about static site generators, I was a bit confused. If this was possible all along, why had we not been using static site generators earlier, was one of my questions. Turns out the answer is: because we didn't really know it was so much better! At least that's how I feel.

This site is hosted using Github Pages, which makes hosting Jekyll sites relatively painless and easy, not to mention very cost-effective.

You can rebuild the site locally in many different ways, before you do:
{% highlight ruby %}
git push -u origin master
{% endhighlight %}
to publish the site to Github.io.

There are many ways to generate the site, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates the site when any file is updated.

To add new posts to your blog, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
