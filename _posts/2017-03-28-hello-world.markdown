THIS STUB IS standing in for an article that I plan to write about my perspective on lean, agile, iterative product management and design, having seen these methods in practice at resource-rich technology innovation companies such as Google, and having seen how slightly smaller and leaner three-person startups do things. There are some interesting similarities, and several striking differences. I hope this will make for a useful article.

Please hang in there while i crank the arm of this Web engine...it should start in a second or two.
