<p>RIGHT BEFORE THE DOT COM boom blossomed into peak irrational exuberance I wrote my master’s degree thesis called “The Almost Chosen Ones” about technogical anxiety and American religions. With an MA in hand, I left my job working at a  technology R&amp;D center and started working at a software product company in Austin, Texas. We didn’t know it at the time, but the bubble was about to burst, and the forecast was for storms.</p>

<p>This particular company had 12 million subscribers paying $15 to $20 a month for a service (I’m going to keep things intentionally vague). To use the service, you would launch a customized Web browser. Here’s the kicker, the part that’s critical to the whole thing: despite being very successful, despite annually recurring revenue in the billions, the service was not at all better or even different than what was offered by 100 similar companies at the time. It was a plain old service, just like all the others.</p>

<p>Why was it was more successful? Somewhere along the way, some clever people in business development had figured out that under the right conditions, Microsoft would be willing to pre-install this browser and place an alias to it on their desktop. When people bought a new Windows computer, a percentage of them would see that colorful icon on the desktop and launch that pre-installed browser. After a bit of marketing, they’d feel inspired to type their credit card number into a form field.</p>
