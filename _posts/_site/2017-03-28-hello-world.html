<p>THIS STUB IS standing in for an article that I plan to write about my perspective on agile, iterative product management and design, having seen these methods in practice at resource-rich technology companies such as Google, and having seen how slightly smaller and slightly less resource-rich startups do things. Large and small companies have a lot to learn from each other, and I hope this theme will make for a useful series of articles.</p>

<p>Please hang in there while i crank the arm of this Web engine. It should start up in a second or twoâ€¦</p>
