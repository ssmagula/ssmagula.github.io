PEOPLE ASK are you a product designer, a UX person, a researcher, a prototyper, or a product manager? 

Here's how I answer.

For many years I've been designing the context in which decisions get made, but I only came to this conclusion a few years ago after I read a book called <cite>Nudge</cite> by Richard Thaler. It was about behavioral economics. A week ago Thaler won the Nobel Prize for Economic Sciences. Prior to reading <cite>Nudge</cite> I had read a lot books and papers about Human-Computer Interaction principles and psychology and was briefly a member of the Association for Computing Machines (ACM) Special Interest Grouo for Computer-Human Interaction (SIG-CHI). The ACM mainly made me jealous of those who attended SIG-CHI conferences in far-off places. HCI and psychology offered a fascinating set of theories such as Hick's Law and Fitts's Law that guide low-level product design decisions such as: how many options should go on a tool bar? How large should this particular button be? 

But product design and product management lacked a "Grand Unified Field Theory" that would tie all the various little theories together to form one overarching, highly predictive, testable theory of what we do when we work at developing new products. 

The terrain that Thaler outlines in <cite>Nudge</cite> is clearly a Grand Unified Field Theory that incorporates HCI and psychology to help predict and explain human decision-making, in all its irrational glory. What's key is that understanding the irrational basis of human decision making is the first step towards improving decision making.

So, to get back to that question: what am I? I have planned and conducted discovery-oriented field studies using both qualitative techniques (partcipant-observer) and quantitative techniques such as random moment sampling and surveys. I've validated (and perhaps more importantly: invalidated) product ideas through research and usability testing with users and customers, but I don't consider myself to be a user experience researcher.

I can write a well-formed user story, know when and why to use acceptance criteria and 'how to demo' criteria, and I can prioritize epics and stories by business value, user value, and properly estimated complexity. I can lead scrum and agile teams as a servant-leader and I can define product and user experience metrics. I know why and when to use entry cohort analysis, and can point to examples of how I used entry cohort analysis in the past with good effect. But I don't consider myself to be only a product manager.

I can design wireframes and  high-fidelity mockups of software using AI or Sketch, and can prototype interactions, transitions, and animations (HTML/CSS, Origami, or InVision). I'm a competent visual designer who is familiar with design, art, art history, principles of typography. I know the difference between Russian constructivism and neo-brutalism and can talk about the role of technology in shaping both how we design and what we design (a Worfian hypothesis). But I'm not a visual design specialist.
 
I'm researcher, product manager, designer, prototyper, and curious person who likes to learn and solve problems.

But I get asked a lot "are you a designer or product person?" This question confuses me, because to me a designer is a product person, and vice-versa. You cannot design a software product effectively without having discovered and validated product ideas with real or proxy users. You cannot properly devise and prioritize a product backlog, without a grasp of peopleâ€”their goals, needs, and preferences for visual and emotional design.

Product thinking includes tasks like validation of problem and solution, prioritization by value and complexity, iterative planning, measurement and evaluation, software engineering principles, designing for change (often called 'agility'). Design thinking requires an understanding of human factors and ergonomics, human psychology, behavioral economics, and the principles of visual communication and emotional design. It's the combination of product thinking with design thinking that yields a holistic view of what the product can and should become. 

So what does Joseph Beuys have to do with all this? When I was in high school in San Francisco, where I grew up, I discovered an German artist named Joseph Beuys. His dictum was "Everyone's an artist." At the time I was in love with chemistry, neurology, and science but I could see that ever-increasing specialization would be required if I became a chemist or a neurologist. This seemed odd to me. Wouldn't I be more capable (not to mention happier) if I were a specialist in a few areas? When I was sixteen years old the answer that I received from my neurologist mentor was basically: you cannot be a specialist in a few areas. You must choose, and choose soon.

Then I read an auto-biographical essay by Joseph Beuys, in it he described being a biological sciences student at a prestigious German university. He was a good student but an uncertainty was nagging him. He felt possibly unsuited to become a professional biologist. This resonated with my sixteen-year old self. Beuys described one particular afternoon when he experienced his epiphany. He was in a lecture hall listening to a professor who had spent his entire life studying the inner organelles of a tiny one-celled organism. Beuys stood up and walked out of the lecture hall, never to return to science. Instead he turned to art. 

He became one of the most influential artists of the Post-WWII era, helping to found the Fluxus movement which inspired many artists to think more conceptually about their art, and what could be accomplished with it. Joseph Beuys saw transforming society as his mission, but it was not his art that would transform society, it was everyman who would do that:

	Joseph Beuys believed that it was possible to transform society 
	through the creativity of every individual. He emerged as an 
	artist amid Germany's post-war reconstruction, claiming for 
	art a unique role in the spiritual regeneration of society, 
	in opposition to a materialistic culture.

Most product managers, researchers, designers, and software engineers who toil long hours at technology startups and corporations would say that they are motivated to work because, deep down, they are striving 'make the world a better place'&dash;through software. And software is changing the world, sometimes for the better. Look at the advances we've made in the last 20 years: peer-to-peer technologies, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, mobile computing, augmented reality, new markets, technology-based crypto-currencies... I could go on and on. But by becoming increasingly specialized, narrowly focused on 'just engineering' or 'just designing' we risk losing the sort of holistic, overarching, transformative vision that can only come from all of us collaborating together. If you want to make the world a better place, the creativity of every individual is needed. This is what Beuys has to teach us.
